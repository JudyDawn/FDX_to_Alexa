    <span style="voice: Matthew">Lidia argued on the phone with her mother while she rushed to catch her bus.</span>
    <span style="voice: Joanna">We need this money.</span>
    <span style="voice: Salli">I understand.</span>

    <span style="voice: Matthew">On a long exhale, Lidia glanced at a couple on the back seat of the bus. There was another woman almost completely hidden by a huge bag resting on her lap.

  <span style="voice: Matthew">Lidia hugged her large art portfolio to her chest and turned to glance out the window at nothing.</span>
  <span style="voice: Matthew">Today she would change her world. With this job, she could repay her mother before Frank found out. He didn't like secrets.</span>
